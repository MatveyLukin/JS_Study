          At the end of May, an accident took place at a combined heat and power
          plant in the Arctic city of Norilsk, in Russia’s Krasnoyarsk Krai.
          Approximately 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled out of a reservoir
          and spread into the surrounding soil and waterways. Nearly all of the
          tributaries of the Daldykan and Ambarnaya rivers around the plant are
          now contaminated with petroleum products. Greenpeace Russia estimates
          that there is at least $86.3 million in damage to bodies of water in
          the region alone. After taking several days to respond to the
          accident, officials in the Krasnoyarsk Krai declared a federal level
          emergency situation on June 3. Two days later, Russia’s Emergencies
          Ministry declared that the spill had been contained. Here’s what the
          spread of the giant fuel spill looks like from space.
